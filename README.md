CountryGamer_Possession
=======================

Inspiration:
'@Pahimar wants a "possession" mod, "where the players spirit, when they are asleep, takes over other mobs"'- @ohaiiChun

Planned Features:
  Overall Goal;
    When a player goes to sleep, their body is left vacant and the user now controls a mob around or near the player.
    If player's body is killed while vacant, SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE
