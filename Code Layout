    ~~PLAYER's body is left in the bed as an NPC
    ~~PLAYER's 'soul' goes on to inhabit another NPC
    ~~PLAYER would have nothing but that NPC's abilities
    ~~Basic actions cannot speed up the night (Sleeping does nothing)
    ~~Must spend entire night cycle as NPC
    ~~If another PLAYER's body is inhabited nearby, there is a chance you could possess that player
    ~~At the end of the night, you must return to your body, else you will die
    ~~If you body is occupied, you cannot return
    ~~The longer you stay in the NPC body, the more benefits you could get, and the harder it is to return
